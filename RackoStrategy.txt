For my computer's strategy, I first created a list called 'check_tower' that consisted of 10 False booleans. I then created a for loop that would run through each value of the original hand and check if it is within a certain range based on its position in the hand. For example, the first card in the computer's hand, or computer[0], was checked to see if it was in the range 1-6, and the second card was checked to see if it was in the range 7-12, and so on in intervals of 6. If the corresponding card was in its designated range, then that place in the 'check_tower' list was changed to true. Next, I used another for loop and an if statement to find the first spot in the hand where its value was not within its designated range and if the current discard card displayed could provide a card in this range. If the discard was within the range, then I ran my 'find_and_replace' function to swap cards. If the discard did not fulfill the hand's needs, I also did the same thing for the 'mystery card' value. If neither of the cards could provide a value that could replace a spot that was currently 'False', the mystery card is placed onto the discard pile and nothing happens for that turn.
